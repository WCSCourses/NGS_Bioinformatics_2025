# Next Generation Sequencing

### 21–28 March 2025, Wellcome Genome Campus, UK

[Wellcome Connecting Science Course Run Website](https://coursesandconferences.wellcomeconnectingscience.org/event/next-generation-sequencing-20250321/) <br /> 
[Course Informatics Guide](https://github.com/WCSCourses/NGS_Bioinformatics_2025/blob/main/Course_Informatics_Guide.md)

Hands-on lab and informatics training for long and short-read sequencing

### Summary

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has become the premier tool in genetic and genomic analysis. This hands-on laboratory and informatics  course is directed at scientists who will be generating and interpreting sequence information in their research and wish to improve their understanding of various sequencing platforms, techniques,  and their applications.

Participants will be able to make informed decisions about appropriate techniques to apply in a variety of research contexts. Training will cover applications for target enrichment, bacterial sequencing, cancer genomic analysis, human variation analysis, and RNA-Seq.

**What will this course cover?**

The programme will include theoretical and practical information on NGS systems currently available and those on the near horizon. Technologies will be chosen from short- and long-read sequencing platforms including:

- PacBio
- Illumina Miseq/HiSeq/Novaseq
- Oxford Nanopore MinION

All the basic techniques of post-sequencing analysis will also be covered in hands-on genomics data analysis sessions including QC, sequence alignment, and variant calling.

### Target Audience

Applications are open to clinical, industry, research professionals, and university students who are either engaged in next-generation sequencing or are aiming to implement it into their future workflows.

This course is not meant to replace the manufacturers’ training normally supplied with new instruments, nor is it intended to be a training course for those solely interested in NGS data analysis (please refer to our website for dedicated bioinformatics courses).

### Learning outcomes

**What will you achieve**

Upon completion of the course, participants should be able to:

- prepare high quality sample libraries for use on next generation sequencing platforms
- set up sequencing runs for the various platforms utilised during this course
- critically assess a sequencing run and distinguish between good and poor-quality data
- describe the advantages and disadvantages of different sequencing technologies in order to select technologies appropriate to specific needs
- process NGS data and use computational tools for sequence alignment and variant-calling

# Programme

The programme will include lectures, seminars, practical sessions, and social events covering the following topics:

**Library Prep**

- Preparing high-quality libraries from samples

**Sequencing**

- Overview: Motivation and fundamental concepts
- Detailed description of prominent sequencing technologies: current and emerging platforms
- preparing chips for sequencing and performing sequencing runs on various platforms

**Data analysis**

- Data QC: How to determine if a sequencing run has performed well
- Alignment to a reference sequence and variant-calling of NGS data

The course will also include seminars by invited speakers, who will highlight their ground-breaking work in the applications of next-generation sequencing.
